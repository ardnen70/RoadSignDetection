# roadSignDetection
Road sign detection using multi-class SVM classifiers
- Demo.py includes the entire version of the code
	- Weights for the SVM classifier are pre computed and saved as numpy array and 
	  this python file reads them as global variables
- SVMandEvaluation.py Computes the classifier, and also does the evaluation by creating the confusion matrix 

- TrainingDataSet.py - Computes features with the algorithm described in the writeup and trains the data and also saves them.
